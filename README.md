We would like you to create a chat application in the language of your choice. This doesnâ€™t have to be a web-based client or even have a UI, but you should be able to connect at least two users to the same chat and be able to send messages between them. We're looking for you to showcase your talents wherever you feel most comfortable either in frontend, backend or both. Optionally, add features that improve the user experience.

You are free to use third-party libraries, and any technologies that would help you implement this, but it should be your own code that we look at and not a pre-built solution. You are also free to use the internet to find any information you may need. What we are looking for is to see how you as an engineer design your solution to the challenge and what the resulting code looks like. Make considerations as you implement this challenge as if it were to be a longer-term project that you want to maintain and extend in the future.

If you have questions about the project or aren't sure how to get started, we are available for a quick meeting on Google Hangouts to explain further and answer questions, just let me know.

A portion of the interview tomorrow will be discussing your work, so be prepared to show us your completed project in some manner. You also may be asked to make changes to it. If you aren't sure how to make this happen, let me know and we can discuss options.
