We would like you to create a chat application in the language of your choice. This doesn’t have to be a web-based client or even have a UI, but you should be able to connect at least two users to the same chat and be able to send messages between them. We're looking for you to showcase your talents wherever you feel most comfortable either in frontend, backend or both. Optionally, add features that improve the user experience.

You are free to use third-party libraries, and any technologies that would help you implement this, but it should be your own code that we look at and not a pre-built solution. You are also free to use the internet to find any information you may need. What we are looking for is to see how you as an engineer design your solution to the challenge and what the resulting code looks like. Make considerations as you implement this challenge as if it were to be a longer-term project that you want to maintain and extend in the future.

If you have questions about the project or aren't sure how to get started, we are available for a quick meeting on Google Hangouts to explain further and answer questions, just let me know.

A portion of the interview tomorrow will be discussing your work, so be prepared to show us your completed project in some manner. You also may be asked to make changes to it. If you aren't sure how to make this happen, let me know and we can discuss options.


Example:

“Hey! How’s It going? Are you working on that exercise Ezoic sent?”

“Pretty good. This challenge is open-ended though so I’m not sure how much code to write.”

“I think a functional app and maybe one or two simple features beyond just sending lines of text is really what they’re looking for.”

“Oh cool. That really cleared it up the task for me. How long do you think I should work on it?”

“Just a few hours. They aren’t looking for anything huge, just an example of how you work.”

“Thanks! I’ve totally got this, and I’m excited for my interview tomorrow. Now I’ve just got to write the code.”

“Good luck tomorrow! I hear the engineers at Ezoic are friendly and have a good sense of humor so there’s no reason to be nervous.”
